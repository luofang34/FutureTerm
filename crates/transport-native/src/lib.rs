//! # Native Transport (Not Yet Implemented)
//!
//! This crate is reserved for future native serial port support.
//! Currently, FutureTerm uses WASM-only transport via `transport-webserial`.
//!
//! **Future Implementation:**
//! - Cross-platform serial port access (Linux, macOS, Windows)
//! - Native USB device enumeration
//! - High-performance I/O without browser constraints
